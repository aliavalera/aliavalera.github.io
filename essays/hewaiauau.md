# _**He wai ʻauʻau**: bath water, a bathing pool, or a place suitable for swimming/washing_

“*He wai ʻauʻau*” is an ʻōlelo noʻeau I was introduced to this semester in my Hawaiian language course, commonly used to describe something that is easy or effortless. I found myself reflecting on this phrase and questioning whether it applied to my (very short) experience in learning Typescript. While I understand the fundamental concepts, writing code in this language required more than I initially expected. 

## Learning a new language through structure
Typescript’s type system has been one of the most challenging aspects of learning. Although this can feel limiting at times, itʻs helped me become more aware of my own coding habits. In many ways, this mirrors the process of learning ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi, where fluency is built by consistently applying the language in context rather than treating it as something separate from everyday use. 

Athletic software engineering reinforces this same idea. The practice WOD’s require repeated exposure and active use of Typescript under pressure, much like incorporating a new language into every aspect of conversation in order to understand it more deeply. While this approach proves stressful, it accelerates familiarity and confidence through consistent practice. 

## So, is Typescript he wai ʻauʻau?
In the beginning, Typescript is not he wai ʻauʻau. It demands patience, discipline, and a willingness to confront mistakes. Over time, however, the difficulty becomes more manageable as patterns emerge and reasoning strengthens. He wai ʻauʻau is not about ease from the beginning, but about reaching a point where effort turns into understanding. Hopefully one day I confidently say "This WOD was he wai ʻauʻau!".
