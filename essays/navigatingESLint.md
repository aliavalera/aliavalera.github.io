Using ESLint with VSCode has changed the way I write code. At first, I felt frustrated by all the warnings and errors. I quickly realized they help me catch patterns I might miss and guide me toward cleaner, more consistent code. Each suggestion sharpens my habits and gradually makes my programs easier to read and maintain.

At the same time, ESLint can slow me down. I sometimes spend more time fixing style issues than focusing on core logic. It feels like a double-edged sword because it enforces professionalism while adding small obstacles in my learning process. Even so, these challenges teach me to think critically about every line I write.

I see ESLint as a tool I need to practice with more to fully understand its recommendations. It pushes me to think carefully about my code and focus on building programs that work as intended. The more I work with it, the more it feels like a guide rather than a burden and shapes me into a more thoughtful and capable programmer.
